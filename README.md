# TraceV3
This is the latest version of 'Leave a Trace' an ios mobile application built in Unity that lets you leave location locked videos for friends and loved ones that they can only acess when they get there! The front-facing part of Trace (TraceV3) was built using Unity and Figma (for UI) and is composed of 138 scripts with 10,000+ lines of code in C# (not counting plugins) and additional code written Objective-C and C++, which is then built to Xcode to deploy onto iPhone. For the backend, I use Firebase Firestore, Firebase Realtime Database, Firebase Cloud Storage, Firebase Auth, Google Analytics, Google Cloud with Node.JS, and APIs such as Mapbox, Google Maps, Twillio, and the Firebase Admin SDK. To get a better high-level understanding, feel free to check out Trace on the [AppStore](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/trace-leave-a-trace/id6450400543) or at our [website](https://www.leaveatrace.app/)!
